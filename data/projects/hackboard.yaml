details:
  - HackBoard is a remake of HackPanel with a more modern design and using new web technologies.
  - I decided to use the Polymer framework with this application, to utilize Web Components.
  - The application was created as part of a contest with Young Rewired State and SAP, which we ended up winning.
  - Differences with HackPanel include integration with the EventBrite API to populate the application with more events and a design that better follows the Material Design specification.
