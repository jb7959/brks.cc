details:
  - HackBoard is a tool that allows users to create a dashboard for hack events where people can go to find live, realtime information about the event.
  - I decided to use the Polymer framework with this application, to utilize Web Components.
  - The application was created as part of a contest with Young Rewired State and SAP, which we ended up winning.
  - We intergrated the EventBrite API to populate the application with events.
