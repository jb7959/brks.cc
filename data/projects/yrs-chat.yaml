details:
  - The project started out as an unofficial online live chat for members of the Young Rewired State community to use during the week of the annual Festival of Code.
  - As participants ourselves, we thought it would be useful to have for the duration of the event.
  - The site was designed as-per branding guidelines, and is now endorsed by the organisation as a primary form of communication between members of the community.
  - I designed the application from scratch and it undertook several overhauls, and it is fully responsive.
