details:
  - HackPanel is a tool that allows users to create a dashboard for hack events where people can go to find live, realtime information about the event.
  - We had plugins for live tweets, GitHub commits, event duration, programming language charts to see what languages were being used, idea generation and more!
  - I wrote all the CSS and also worked with some JavaScript and jQuery for lightboxes, and I built a PHP plugin or two with help from my teammates.
  - HackPanel was nominated for Best Example of Design in the Festival of Code in 2014.
