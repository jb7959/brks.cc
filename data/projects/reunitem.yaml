details:
  - Reunitem was the first project I worked on as part of a team.
  - I was one of two people managing the Front-end of the application and I was mostly responsible for the branding and styles.
  - The idea behind Reunitem was to create an online Lost-and-found solution.
  - Users could logon and report items as Lost or Found, and then they would be shown on a large map with custom pins depending on the category of the item.
  - The app was nominated for the 'Best Example of Design' award at the Festival of Code in 2013.
