  - This hack was created as a concept for a new way of engaging people at Museums.
  - We based it on the V&A museum in London because they had the most-complete dataset at the time.
  - The idea behind this project was to engage children more at museums by creating a treasure hunt around the exhibits.
  - Users would participate by using the app on their phones and they had to goto specified exhibits as listed on the application and scan a QR code, to mark that exhibit as visited.
  - This would allow the museum to get more people to specific exhibits, if they wanted to, and to see which exhibits get the most visits.
  - My role in the application was to work on the web dashboard, where each exhibit was assigned a QR code which could then be downloadable through the web interface.
